Minimal JSON parsing module that both encodes and decodes.
When encoding, JSON types are mapped to Erlang terms as follows:

* JSON object is Erlang map
* JSON string is Erlang binary
* JSON list is Erlang list
* JSON numbers are Erlang numbers

When decoding, everything is vice versa except strings. Strings are
parsed to lists. You can alter this behavior to fit your preferences
by editing decode_string/2 in this file.
